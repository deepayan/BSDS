# Motivation

* Suppose we have paired bivariate data $(X\sub{i}, Y\sub{i}), i = 1, 2, \dotsc, n$, where

	* $Y$ is a "response" or "dependent" variable, and 
	
	* $X$ is a "predictor" or "independent" variable

* So far, we have considered the case where $Y$ is numeric, $X$ is either categorical or numeric

# Example: Categorical $X$

* Distribution of $Y$


```r
library(NHANES)
bwplot(BPSysAve ~ Race1 | Gender, data = NHANES, subset = Age >= 21)
```

* Summarize (conditional) distribution of $Y$ by median


```r
bwplot(BPSysAve ~ Race1 | Gender, data = NHANES, subset = Age >= 21,
       panel = panel.average, fun = function(x) median(x, na.rm = TRUE), col = "black")

# Categorical response

* The other combinations we can consider:

	* $Y$ categorical, $X$ categorical
	
	* $Y$ categorical, $X$ numeric

--

* In this course, we will only consider the first case

* In fact, we will typically consider $Y$ to be binary (two categories)

---

# Contingency tables summarizing categorical data

* Categorical data can be summarized by frequency of each combination

* This process is known as _cross-tabulation_

* The resulting summary is known as a _contingency table_

# Representing contingency tables

* The above examples show two standard methods to represent contingency tables

* The data frame representation is more familiar to us

* The "table"-like format is more standard in many situations

--

* The "table" representation is generalized to "arrays" in R

* We can switch between the representations using `xtabs()` and `array2DF()`

# Summarizing conditional distribution of $Y$

* For numeric $Y$, we can summarize the distribution by center (mean / median)

* For categorical $Y$, the natural summary is proportions in each category

--

* For binary response, this can be sample proportion of any one category

--

* However, it is also common to measure it by the "odds" of one of the categories

---

# Odds

* Let the probability of an event $A$ be $p = P(A)$

* Think of $A$ as the event of "success" ("Admitted" in the example above)

--

* The "odds" are defined as the ratio of success probability and failure probability

$$
\text{odds of } A = \frac{P(A)}{P(A^C)} = \frac{p}{1-p}
$$

--

* Examples

	* For $p = 0.5$, the odds are 1 ("50-50 odds")

	* For $p = 0.9$, the odds are $0.9 / 0.1 = 9$ ("9 to 1 odds")
	
	* For $p = 0.2$, the odds are $0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25$ ("odds are 4 to 1 against")

---

# Odds as a transformation

* The idea of odds is closer to how we usually think of probability

* Mathematically, we can think of $p \mapsto \frac{p}{1-p}$ as a transformation

* This transformation converts the bounded parameter $p$ to an unbounded parameter

--

* However, the odds are still bounded below by $0$

* It is "asymmetric" in the sense that 

	* for unfavourable odds, $p < 0.5 \implies \text{odds} \in [0, 1)$

	* for favourable odds, $p > 0.5 \implies \text{odds} \in (1, \infty)$

---

# Log odds

* We often symmetrize this by considering the log-odds $\log \frac{p}{1-p}$

* The value of log-odds can be any real number

--

* The log-odds transformation is often useful for proportions

# Odds ratio

* Suppose we want to compare success probability in two groups

* For example, probability of admission for males vs females

--

* Odds ratio: Compute odds for both groups, take their ratio

--

* Interpretation: If $B$ represents predictor (e.g., gender), odds ratio is

$$
\frac{  {P(A \mid B)} / {P(A^C \mid B)} }{ {P(A \mid B^C)} / {P(A^C \mid B^C)}  }
$$

* Clearly, log of odds ratio is the difference between log odds (zero means no difference)

# Are two attributes independent?

* Natural next question: Are two attributes _independent_? (in the population)

* We can consider the admissions data as an example


```r
t(UCBAdmissions[, c(2, 1), "C"])
```

```
        Admit
Gender   Admitted Rejected
  Female      202      391
  Male        120      205
```

--

* Question (about population)

	* Assume that this represents a random sample from all potential applicants

	* Is that data consistent with what we would expect if there is no gender bias?
	
---

* Alternate formulation: We can calculate the log odds ratio


```r
log(oddsratio(t(UCBAdmissions[, c(2, 1), "C"])))
```

```
[1] -0.1249216
```

* Is this value sufficiently different from zero?

--

* To answer this question, we need to know what the odds ratio _could_ have been under independence

--

* Answering such questions is an important reason for studying Statistics formally

* This sort of insight is more valuable than simple data summarization and visualization

--

* This area of Statistics is known as _inference_ (what we have been doing is _descriptive statistics_)

---

* How can we approach this problem?


```r
X <- t(UCBAdmissions[, c(2, 1), "C"])
X
```

```
        Admit
Gender   Admitted Rejected
  Female      202      391
  Male        120      205
```

```r
log(oddsratio(X))
```

```
[1] -0.1249216
```

* Intuitively, bias against female candidates $\implies$ large negative value for log odds ratio
	
* But how large should the value be to decide that there is bias?

--

* We will study such questions using parametric models in the next semester

* Here, we will consider a simple intuitive approach

---

* We want to study the "distribution" of log odds ratio _if there was no bias_

* Of course, we do not know whether there was any bias

--

* Imagine doing a hypothetical experiment 

	* Suppose gender of candidate is hidden from admission committee
	
	* This will guarantee that there was no gender bias

--

* If the process was indeed gender-neutral, then the outcomes would not have changed

--

* Even if we added fake random values for gender, the outcomes would not have changed

--

* This is something we can do easily: 

	* Take all candidates, keep admission status unchanged, but assign gender randomly
	
	* How many females vs males? Easiest to keep the totals unchanged
	
	* This is equivalent to randomly permuting the gender variable

---

# Permutation test for independence

* We can repeat this process as many times as we want

* These are simulations from the _distribution_ of log odds ratio (under independence)


```r
sim_logOR <-
    replicate(10000,
              {
                  dlong$GenderRandomized <- sample(dlong$Gender)
                  log(oddsratio(xtabs(~ GenderRandomized + Admit, dlong)))
              })
```


```r
str(sim_logOR)

 num [1:10000] 0.3191 -0.187 -0.1249 0.1474 -0.0418 ...

* Is the observed value unusual?

--

* Roughly 20% of simulations had log OR less than the observed value

* So we should probably not consider this very strong evidence of gender bias

--

* This procedure is known as _Fisher's Exact Test of Independence_

---

* Department E had the most negative log odds ratio


```r
X <- t(UCBAdmissions[, c(2, 1), "E"])
X

Gender   Admitted Rejected
  Female       94      299

# Exercise

* Try this for department A

--

* Do we really need to do this permutation?

* Note that if row totals are fixed, log OR depends only on $X\sub{11}$

--

* Exercise: Explicitly calculate distribution of $X\sub{11}$ given row and column totals
