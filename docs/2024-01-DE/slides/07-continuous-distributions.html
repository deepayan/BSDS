# Discrete vs Continuous distributions

* We have mentioned the Normal distribution several times

* But most specific examples we have considered are from discrete
  populations
 
--

* Discrete populations are more natural

* Why do we need the Normal distribution?

--

* One way to justify Normal and other continuous distributions are as useful approximations

# Continuous distributions

---

* Example: Discrete Uniform

	* Equally likely outcomes on a finite set $S = \set{ s\sub{1}, \dotsc, s\sub{n}}$

	* Simplest example: $S = \set{ 1, 2, \dotsc, n}$

---

* Distribution (probability mass function) $P(X = s)$ of Discrete Uniform on $S = \set{
  1, 2, \dotsc, 10}$

---

* Distribution (probability mass function) $P(X = s)$ of Discrete Uniform on $S = \set{
  1, 2, \dotsc, 100}$

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figures/contdist-unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg)

---

* Cumulative Distribution Function $F(s) = P(X \leq s)$ of Discrete Uniform on $S = \set{ 1, 2, \dotsc, 10}$

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figures/contdist-unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg)

---

* Cumulative Distribution Function $F(s) = P(X \leq s)$ of Discrete Uniform on $S = \set{ 1, 2, \dotsc, 100}$

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figures/contdist-unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg)

---

* Natural limiting approximation: Uniform on interval $S = (0, 1)$

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figures/contdist-unnamed-chunk-5-1.svg)

---

* Cumulative Distribution Function $F(s) = P(X \leq s)$ of Discrete Uniform on $S = \set{ 1, 2, \dotsc, n}$

$$
F(s) = P(X \leq s) = \frac{s}{n} 
= \sum\limits\sub{x = 1}^s P(X = x) = \sum\limits\sub{x = 1}^s \frac{1}{n} \text{ for } s \leq n
$$

--

* Cumulative Distribution Function $F(s) = P(X \leq s)$ of Uniform on interval $S = (0, 1)$

$$
F(s) = P(X \leq s) = s = \int\limits\sub{0}^s f(x) \text{d}x = \int\limits\sub{0}^s 1 \, \text{d}x \text{ for } s \leq 1 
$$

--

* This gives probabilities for intervals and other events that can be derived from them

* We call this the Uniform$(0, 1)$ distribution or simply $U(0, 1)$

---

* In general, probabilities can be computed using any "density function" f using

$$
F(s) = P(X \leq s) = \int\limits\sub{-\infty}^s f(x) \text{d}x
$$

* To ensure total probability equals 1, $f$ must satisty $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, and

$$
\int\limits\sub{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \, \text{d}x = 1
$$

--

* Many such $f$ can be constructed, but which are important?

# Statistics based on Uniform$(0, 1)$

---

* Suppose $\nseq{U} \sim U(0, 1)$

* How do summary statistics based on $\nseq{U}$ behave?

--

* Statistics we have studied: sample mean, sample median, other sample quantiles

* These give rise to three fundamental distributions: Beta, Normal, and Exponential

---

* Distribution of $U\sub{(k)}$ is Beta$(k, n-k+1)$

* Density $f: \mathbb{R} \to [0, \infty)$ of Beta$(a, b)$ is

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
  C(a, b) \, x^{a-1} (1-x)^{b-1} & x \in [0, 1] \cr
  0 & x \not\in [0, 1]
\end{cases}
$$

* This is an exact distribution

---

* What happens to distribution of $U\sub{(1)}$?

--

* What happens to distribution of $n U\sub{(1)}$?

--

* The limiting distribution is the Exponential distribution $f(x) = e^{-x} 1\sub{\set{ x > 0}}$

---

* What happens to distribution of median $U\sub{(n/2)}$?

--

* To avoid ambiguity, assume $n = 2k - 1$ is odd

* Median is $U\sub{(k)} \sim \text{Beta}(k, k)$

* What happens to distribution of (standardized)

$$
2 \sqrt{2k + 1} \left( U\sub{(k)} - \frac12 \right)
$$

--

* The limiting distribution is the Normal distribution $f(x) = C e^{-x^2}$

---

* In both these cases this is easy to "verify" by calculating $f(x)$ explicitly

* It is also possible to verify empirically using Q-Q plots

--

* It can also be shown that the sample mean $\bar{U}$ has a limiting Normal distribution

* The required standardization is similar to the median

$$
\sqrt{12 n} \left( \bar{U} - \frac12 \right)
$$

* Direct calculation of density of $\bar{U}$ is difficult (can be done using the [Convolution Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem))

* Easy to verify empirically using Q-Q plots

# Central Limit Theorems

* The sample mean and sample median have limiting Normal distributions in many other cases

* These results are known as Central Limit Theorems, and are very useful in practice

---

# Estimation of density

* Natural question: How to estimate density $f$ from data $\nseq{X}$?

* Two approaches:

	* Binning 
	
	* Point-wise estimation
