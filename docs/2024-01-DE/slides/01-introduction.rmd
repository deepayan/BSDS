# Some Mathematical Problems

---

# Divisors of numbers

- Supose you are given a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$

	- Is $n$ a prime number?

--

	- Is $n$ a [perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) number?

--

	- Examples
	   <div>
	   \begin{eqnarray*}
	   6   &=& 1 + 2 + 3 \cr
	   28  &=& 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 \cr
	   496 &=& 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248
	   \end{eqnarray*}
	   </div>

--

	- Find the [aliquot sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliquot_sum) of $n$
      $$
	  s(n) = \sum\limits\sub{d \vert n, d \neq n} d
	  $$
 
---

# Taxicab number: 1729

- Famously identified by Ramanujan as the 

	> smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two positive integer cubes in 2 distinct ways 

	$$1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3$$

--

- What is next such number? 

- And the next, and so on?

---

# The house number problem

- In 1914, Ramanujan and Prasanta Mahalanobis (then a student) were staying together in London

- Mahalanobis read a [problem](images/house-problem-fullpage.jpg) in the Strand magazine that he posed to Ramanujan

<img style="width: 50%;" src="images/house-problem.jpg"></img>

---

# The house number problem

- In 1914, Ramanujan and Prasanta Mahalanobis (then a student) were staying together in London

- Mahalanobis read a [problem](images/house-problem-fullpage.jpg) in the Strand magazine that he posed to Ramanujan

- In mathematical terms, the problem is to find a pair of integers $(m, n)$ such that $50 < m < 500$ and
  $$
  1 + 2 + \dotsc + (n-1) = (n+1) + (n+2) + \dotsc + m
  $$

--

- Ramanujan of course found an elegant solution that you can read about [here](https://bhavana.org.in/timeless-geniuses-celestial-clocks-and-continued-fractions/)

- Can _you_ find the solution?

- Are there other solutions when there are no bounds on $m$?

---

# The birthday problem

- Probability $p(n)$ of no common birthdays in a group of $n$ people

--

- Exact answer
  $$p(n) = \left(1 - \frac{1}{365} \right) \left(1 - \frac{2}{365} \right) \dotsm \left(1 - \frac{n-1}{365} \right)$$

- Approximate answer (why?) 
  $$p(n) = \left(1 - \frac{1}{365} \right)^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$$

--

- How do we calculate for specific $n$?

- How good is the approximation?

- What if birthdays are not equally likely?

---

# A more complicated experiment: Snakes and Ladders 

- How many throws of the dice does it take to reach the end?
  <img style="width: 40%; float: right" src="images/snl.jpg"></img>

--

	- This is a "random" experiment
	
	- Answer depends on sequence of dice throws
	
	- Can we calculate "average" number of throws needed?

	- More generally, "distribution" of number of throws?

# The R Programming Environment

---

# Why R?

- [Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) and 
  [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition)

- Popular

- Easy to try out on your own

--

- Python and Julia are other good alternatives


---

# Interacting with R

* R is most commonly used as a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)

	* When it is started, R waits for user input

--

	* User inputs expression

--

	* R evaluates and prints result

	* Waits for more input

--

* Julia and Python have the same REPL interface

* Several _interfaces_ are available to help in this process

	* Recommended interface: [_RStudio_](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

--

	* Another popular interface: [_Jupyter_](https://jupyter.org/) (named after Julia, Python, R)

	* Available online (with a Google account) as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)


<!-- # Installing R and RStudio -->

<!-- * Go to <https://cran.icts.res.in/> (or choose a [mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) first) -->

<!-- * Follow instructions depending on your platform (Windows for most of you) -->

<!-- * For RStudio, go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> -->

---

# Try to install R and RStudio!

* R is available from <https://www.r-project.org>

* [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is available from [Posit](https://posit.co/) 

---

# Running R

* Once installed, you can start RStudio to get something like this:

```

* The `>` represents a _prompt_ indicating that R is waiting for input.

* The difficult part is to learn what to do next

# The R REPL essentially works like a calculator

```{r}
34 * 23 + 10
```

--

```{r}
27 + 1 / 7
```

--

```{r}
2^10 # power
```
--

```{r}
28 %% 6 # modulus
```

--

```{r}
(1 - 1 / 365) * (1 - 2 / 365) * (1 - 3/365) # p(4) - birthday probability
```


---

layout: true

# R supports mathematical functions

---

```{r}
sqrt(5 * 125)
sin(pi / 3)
sin(pi / 3)^2 + cos(pi / 3)^2
```

---

layout: false

# Variables and functions

* All examples so far use explicit values (like a calculator)

* But R is much more: it is a full programming language

* Two basic features: variables and functions

---

# R supports variables

```{r}
x <- 2     # assignment can be done using <-
y = 10     # it can also be done using = 
x^y
y^x
factorial(y)
```

---

# R has functions

* Most operations are performed using functions 

* We have already seen some examples

* A function is usually called by name, followed by arguments in
  parentheses
  
```{r}
choose(y, x)
sqrt(x)
```
  
---

# R has functions and operators

* Many operations are done using _operators_

```{r}
x + y
x * y
```

--

* These are actually also functions

```{r}
`+`(x, y)
`*`(x, y)
```

---

layout: false

# Vectors

* All calculations so far have been with ‘scalar’ numbers

* Computations often involve a _collection_ of numbers

* Example: sum, mean, median, ...

--

* The data structure we use for this is called a _vector_

* Also sometimes called _arrays_ in other programming languages


---

# A simple way to generate vectors

* The `seq()` function or the `:` operator

```{r}
x:y
seq(x, y)
```

--

* `seq()` has more options

```{r}
seq(x, y, by = 0.1)
```

---

layout: true

# Another simple way to generate vectors: Simulation

---

* Real data will usually need to be imported from some external source (later)

* Easy way to generate fake data: use a random number generator

--

* Example: `sample()` to simulate throws of a die

```{r}
sample(1:6)
```

--

```{r}
sample(1:6, 20)
```

--

```{r}
sample(1:6, 20, replace = TRUE)
```


---

layout: true

# Function arguments

---

* Functions have named input arguments

* Usually easy to identify using `str()`

```{r}
str(sample)
```

* Default choice is to sample _without replacement_

* For more details, try running `help(sample)`

---

layout: false

# Application: Birthday problem simulation 

* To do anything with a vector, we usually first assign it to a variable

```{r}
x <- sample(1:365, 71)
```

--

* We can _print_ the vector (by just typing its name)

```{r}
x
```

--

- What does this tell us? 

	- Nothing useful, unless we repeat this many times
	
	- We will come back to this later

---

# Application: Birthday problem exact calculation

- Remember, we want to calculate
  $$p(71) = \left(1 - \frac{1}{365} \right) \left(1 - \frac{2}{365} \right) \dotsm \left(1 - \frac{70}{365} \right)$$

- We can at least easily generate the varying part of these terms

```{r}
x <- 1:70
x
```

---

# Summary functions

* We can now call various standard _summary_ functions that compute various statistics

```{r}
sum(x)
length(x)
prod(x)
```

--

* But none of these are immediately useful

---

layout: true

# Vectorized functions

---

* Some R functions operate on vectors _elementwise_

* In fact, most standard mathematical functions and operators are
  _vectorized_

---

* Example: Divide each element of `x` by 365

```{r}
x / 365
```

---

* Example: Calculate `1 - x / 365` elementwise

```{r}
1 - x / 365
```

---

* Birthday Problem Calculation: now take product

```{r}
prod(1 - x / 365)
```

---

* What about for 23 people?

```{r}
x <- 1:22
prod(1 - x / 365)
```

---

layout: false

# Defining new functions: Exact birthday probability

```{r}
p <- function(n) {
    x <- 1:(n-1)
    prod(1 - x / 365)
}
```

--

```{r}
p(20)
p(21)
p(22)
p(23)
```

---

# Defining new functions: Approximate birthday probability

```{r}
p1 <- function(n) {
    S <- n * (n-1) / 2
    (1 - 1 / 365)^S
}
```

```{r}
p1(20)
p1(21)
p1(22)
p1(23)
```

---

# Defining new functions: Key points to remember

* Functions consist of one or more expressions / statements

* Expressions are run __sequentially__

* Variables in expressions must have been defined earlier (last assigned value is used)

* Arguments of a function can be used as variables within the function

* Last evaluated expression is the "return" value

---

layout: true

# Birthday problem by simulation

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(20240526)
```


```{r}
d <- sample(1:365, 23, replace = TRUE)
d
```

* We need to determine whether there are duplicates

* Several options

---

* Option 1: Use the `duplicated()` function with logical summary function `any()`

```{r}
duplicated(d)
any(duplicated(d))
```

---

* Option 2: Use the `duplicated()` function and count duplicates

```{r}
duplicated(d)
sum(duplicated(d))
sum(duplicated(d)) > 0
```

---

* Option 3: Use the `unique()` function and count unique birthdays

```{r}
unique(d)
length(unique(d))
length(unique(d)) < length(d)
```

---

* Pick one and simulate result using a function

```{r}
sim_birthday <- function(n) {
    d <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
    length(unique(d)) == length(d) # TRUE if all distinct
}
```

---

* Pick one and simulate result using a function

```{r}
sim_birthday(23)
sim_birthday(23)
sim_birthday(23)
sim_birthday(23)
sim_birthday(23)
```

---

* Use `replicate()` to repeat this process many times

```{r}
replicate(20, sim_birthday(23))
s <- replicate(50000, sim_birthday(23))
sum(s) / length(s)
```

---

* Observed proportion should ‘converge’ to true probability

* This is known as the Law of Large Numbers

* Does simulated data show this behaviour?

---

layout: false

# Summary

# Appendix


---

# Algorithms

- The fundamental building block of computer programs are algorithms

- An algorithm is essentially a set of instructions to solve a problem

- Algorithms usually require some inputs

- Instructions are executed sequentially, finally resulting in an
  output (also called _return value_)

- You can think of an algorithm as a recipe (inputs: ingredients, output: food!)

---

layout: true

# Example: is a given number $n$ prime?

---

- Basic idea: see if $n$ is divisible by any number between $2$ and $n-1$

- Obviously, enough to check whether $n$ is divisible by any number between $2$ and $\sqrt{n}$

- Intuitively, the second approach is more "efficient"

- Also, we can stop as soon as we find the first divisor

---

- Simple algorithms are often easy to understand as a _flowchart_


![flowchart](images/isprime-flowchart.svg)



---

- But we will usually write algorithms in the form of _pseudo-code_ as follows:

.algorithm[
.name[`is\_prime(n)`]
i := 2
__while__ (i $\leq$ sqrt(n)) {
    __if__ (n mod i == 0) {
        __return__ FALSE
    }
    i := i + 1
}
__return__ TRUE
]

- Here we skip checking whether $n > 1$ (and that it is an integer)

---

layout: true

# How to interpret an algorithm?

---

- The meaning of this algorithm / pseudo-code should be more or less obvious

- Assumes availability of certain basic operators / functions (mod, sqrt)

- We often employ some _conventions_ and use some _structures_ in pseudo-code

- For example,

.algorithm[
.name[`is\_prime(n)`]
i := 2                    // variable assignment
__while__ (i $\leq$ sqrt(n)) {    // loop while condition holds
    __if__ (n mod i == 0) {   // branch if condition holds
        __return__ FALSE      // exits with output value
    }                     // end of blocks within loops, branches, etc.
    i := i + 1            // update variable value
}
__return__ TRUE
]

---

- It is important to make sure that an algorithm makes sense

- Steps are executed sequentially, so the sequence must be clear
	
- It must be possible to evaluate each step

	- All variables used must have been defined in a previous step
	
	- It is OK to call other functions (or algorithms), but they must be clearly defined

	- It is even OK for an algorithm to call itself (this is known as _recursion_)

---

layout: true

# Pseudo-code

---

- The general structure of algorithms is derived from a language called [ALGOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL)

- However, there are no fixed rules that pseudo-code must follow

- An alternative form of our `is_prime` algorithm could be:

.algorithm[
.name[`is\_prime(n)`]
i = 2                  // different assignment operator
__while__ i $\leq$ sqrt(n)     // end of loop indicated by indentation
    __if__ n mod i == 0
        __return__ FALSE
    i = i + 1
__return__ TRUE
]

---

- Another form could be:

.algorithm[
.name[`is\_prime(n)`]
i $\leftarrow$ 2                 // yet another assignment operator
__while__ i $\leq$ sqrt(n)     // end of loop indicated by __end__ keyword
    __if__ n mod i == 0
        __return__ FALSE
    __end__
    i $\leftarrow$ i + 1
__end__
__return__ TRUE
]

- Any of these forms are fine as long as 

	- the steps of the algorithm are clearly specified

	- the essential ideas are expressed without ambiguity


---

layout: true

# Functions and control flow structures

---

* The main building blocks of our programs are going to be functions

* Functions are concrete implementations of algorithms

* Functions usually

	- have one or more input arguments,

	- perform some computations, possibly calling other functions, and

	- return one or more output values.

* The second step is the main contribution of a function
--

* Usually a programming language will already have many built-in functions

* These can be called by other functions

* Knowing what is available is an essential part of "learning" a language


<!-- * Additional libraries or packages will provide more standard functions -->


---

* The standard model for performing computations is __sequential
  execution__

* In other words, a function executes a set of instructions in a specified sequence

* Some control flow structures may be used to create branches or loops
  in the flow of execution
  
---

* Briefly, the main ingredients used are

	- Declaration of variables (implicit in some languages)

	- Evaluation of expressions. _Can involve variables provided they
	  have been defined in an earlier step_

	- Assignment to variables (to store intermediate results for later use)

	- Logical tests (equal?, less than?, greater than?, is more input available?)

	- Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)

	- Branching — take different paths based on result of a logical
	  operation (if-then-else)

	- Loops — repeat sequence of steps, a fixed number of times, or
	  while a condition holds (for / while)
--

* The details of how variables store values, and who can access them
  (scope) are important
  
* But we will not worry about these issues for now


---

layout: false

# Common operators (may have language-specific variants)

- _Mathematical operators_: 
    - `+` (addition)
	- `*` (multiplication)
	- `/` (division — possibly integer division)
	- `^` (power)
	- `%` (the modulo operation)

- _Logical operators_: 
	- `&` (AND)
	- `|` (OR)
	- `!` (NOT)

- _Comparisons_: 
	- `==` (equality)
	- `!=` ($\neq$)
	- `<`, `>` (strictly less than or greater than) 
	- `<=` `>=` ($\leq$, $\geq$)

- _Mathematical functions_: `round, floor, ceil, abs, sqrt, exp, log, sin, cos, ...`



---

# Practical implementation: programming languages

* Some standard languages suitable for structured programming are

	- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) (compiled)
	- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) (compiled)
	- [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29) (interpreted)
	- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) (interpreted)
	- [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_%28programming_language%29) (interpreted)

* There are also many others with various relative strengths and weaknesses


---

# Example: The `is_prime` algorithm in various languages

* We will demonstrate with a slight modification to use only integer
  arithmetic (avoid square root)

.algorithm[
.name[`is\_prime(n)`]
i := 2
__while__ (i * i $\leq$ n) {
    __if__ (n mod i == 0) {
        __return__ FALSE
    }
  i := i + 1
}
__return__ TRUE
]


---

# Example: The `is_prime` algorithm in various languages

* Implemented in C, the algorithm would look like this:


```c
int is_prime_c(int n) 
{
	int i = 2;
	while (i * i <= n) {
		if (n % i == 0) {
			return 0;
		}
		i = i + 1;
	}
	return 1;
}
```

* C is a compiled language, so actually running this code involves
  some additional work

* Note that all variable _types_ need to be explicitly declared

* This includes the types of function arguments (inputs) and return value (output)


---

# Example: The `is_prime` algorithm in various languages

* The same algorithm would look like this in R:

```{r}
is_prime_r <- function(n)
{
	i <- 2
	while (i * i <= n) {
		if (n %% i == 0) {
			return (FALSE)
		}
		i <- i + 1
	}
	return (TRUE)
}
```

* The basic structure is very similar, but with some differences:

    - The assignment operator is different (but `=` also works in R)
    - The function declaration looks like a variable assignment
    - The modulo operator is `%%` instead of `%`
    - Uses `TRUE` and `FALSE` instead of `1` and `0` for logical values
	- Statements do not end with a semicolon (although they could)
	- Variable types are not declared
	- The return value must be put in parentheses


---

# Example: The `is_prime` algorithm in various languages

* We can call this function after starting R and copy-pasting the function definition 


```{r}
is_prime_r(4)
is_prime_r(10)
is_prime_r(100)
is_prime_r(101)
```


---

# Example: The `is_prime` algorithm in various languages

* The implementation looks a little different in Python:

```{python}
def is_prime_py(n):
	i = 2
	while i * i <= n:
		if n % i == 0:
			return 0;
		i = i + 1
	return 1
```

* The main difference is in how code blocks are defined: 

	- start with a colon (`:`) 
	
	- end is defined by indentation (amount of space in the beginning)

* Changing indentation will change meaning of code, which does not happen in C or R

* However, code in all languages _should be indented properly for readability_


---

# Example: The `is_prime` algorithm in various languages

* Again, we can start python, define the function, and run the following code

```{python}
print(is_prime_py(4))
print(is_prime_py(10))
print(is_prime_py(100))
print(is_prime_py(101))
```
