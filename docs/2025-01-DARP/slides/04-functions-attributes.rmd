# Functions

* Most useful things in R happen by calling functions

* Functions have one or more arguments

    * All arguments have names (available as variables inside the function)

	* Arguments may be compulsory or optional

	* Optional arguments usually have "default" values 

--

* Arguments may or may not be named when the function is called
	
	* Unnamed arguments are matched by position

	* Optional arguments are usually named
	
* Functions normally also have a useful "return" value


```{r opts, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, cache.path='~/knitr-cache/darp-funcattr/', autodep = TRUE,
               comment = "", warning = TRUE, message = TRUE,

               dev = "svglite", dev.args = list(pointsize = 15, bg = "transparent"),
               knitr.table.format = "html",

# Example: Delhi Air Quality data

---

```{r}
aqi <- read.csv("https://deepayan.github.io/BSDS/2024-01-DE/data/rkpuram-aqi.csv")
str(aqi)
```

---

* How is AQI (PM10) related to `no2` (Nitrogen dioxide)?

--

* Basic tools we are familiar with

	* Scatter plot
	
	* Linear Regression

---

```{r}
plot(pm10 ~ no2, data = aqi)
```

---

```{r}
plot(sqrt(pm10) ~ sqrt(no2), data = aqi)
```

---

* Formula for linear regression line

<div>
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{b} &=& \frac{\sum (x\sub{i} - \bar{x}) (y\sub{i} - \bar{y})}{\sum (x\sub{i} - \bar{x})^2} \cr
\hat{a} &=& \bar{y} - \hat{b} \bar{x}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
</div>
	
---

* Calculation of linear regression line

```{r}
x <- sqrt(aqi$no2)
y <- sqrt(aqi$pm10)
xbar <- mean(x)
ybar <- mean(y)
sxy <- sum( (x - xbar) * (y - ybar) )
sxx <- sum( (x - xbar)^2 )
```

--

```{r}
c(xbar, ybar, sxx, sxy)
```

---

* Regression coefficients removing missing values

```{r}
x <- sqrt(aqi$no2)
y <- sqrt(aqi$pm10)
xbar <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
ybar <- mean(y, na.rm = TRUE)
sxy <- sum( (x - xbar) * (y - ybar), na.rm = TRUE)
sxx <- sum( (x - xbar)^2, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
c(xbar, ybar, sxx, sxy)
```

---

* Even this may not be correct: should remove both if only one missing!

```{r}
x <- sqrt(aqi$no2)
y <- sqrt(aqi$pm10)
ok <- is.finite(x) & is.finite(y)
xbar <- mean(x[ok]); ybar <- mean(y[ok])
sxy <- sum( (x[ok] - xbar) * (y[ok] - ybar))
sxx <- sum( (x[ok] - xbar)^2)
```

```{r}
c(xbar, ybar, sxx, sxy)
```

---

* Coefficients of linear regression line

```{r}
bhat <- sxy / sxx
ahat <- ybar - bhat * xbar
c(intercept = ahat, slope = bhat)
```

--

* Standard R function to do this

```{r}
lm(sqrt(pm10) ~ sqrt(no2), data = aqi)
```

---

* Add regression line to scatter plot

```{r}
plot(sqrt(pm10) ~ sqrt(no2), data = aqi)
abline(ahat, bhat, col = 2)
```

# Functions

---

* We have used several functions above

	* `sqrt()`, `mean()`, `sum()` — basic mathematical / summary functions
	
	* `plot()` — "high level" plotting function
	
	* `abline()` — "low level" plotting function
	
	* `lm()` — "high level" modeling function

---

* We will discuss graphics functions in more detail later

--

* `lm()` is a good example to study the behaviour of modeling functions in R

--

* Recall:

	* Functions have one or more arguments

    * All arguments have names (available as variables inside the function)

	* Arguments may be compulsory or optional

	* Optional arguments usually have "default" values 



---

* `lm()` fits a more general class of models known as _linear models_

```{r}
str(lm)
```

--

* These calls are equivalent

```{r}
fm1 <- lm(pm10 ~ no2, aqi, (no2 < 100))
fm2 <- lm(pm10 ~ no2, data = aqi, method = "qr", subset = (no2 < 100))
coef(fm1)
coef(fm2)
```

---

* Rule: named arguments are matched by name, remaining by position

* Convention: 

	- First few "standard" arguments are usually unnamed (matched by position)
	
	- Usually unnamed arguments are _not_ used after named arguments

--

* The following call is equivalent to previous two, but not recommended

```{r}
fm3 <- lm(pm10 ~ no2, data = aqi, no2 < 100)
coef(fm3)
```

---

* The return value of `lm()` is a list

.scrollable400[

```{r}
str(fm2)
```

]

---

* Individual elements can be extracted using list indexing

```{r}
fm2$coefficients
fm2$residuals
```

---

layout: true

# Attributes

---

* The names (derived from row names of the data) can be used as index 

```{r}
fm2$residuals["25"]
```

* The names associated with a vector can be obtained using `names()`

```{r}
names(fm2$residuals)
```

---

* These names are actually stored as an _attribute_ called "names"

```{r}
attr(fm2$residuals, "names")
```

---

* This is true for all vector objects, including lists

```{r}
attr(fm2, "names")
```

---

* Attributes are arbitrary R objects that can be attached to any other object

* Typically used for programming convenience, normally not seen by users

* However, some attributes are "special"

---

* The "names" attribute can be extracted using the function `names()`

* `dimnames()` similarly gives row / column names for matrices and arrays

```{r}
dimnames(Titanic)
```

---

* The "names" attribute can be extracted using the function `names()`

* `dimnames()` similarly gives row / column names for matrices and arrays

```{r}
attr(Titanic, "dimnames")
```


---

* For example, column names can be obtained as

```{r}
dimnames(Titanic)[[2]]
```

* There are convenient shortcuts called `rownames()` and `colnames()`

```{r}
colnames(Titanic)
```

---

* In fact, we can easily verify that this is what `colnames()` is doing by printing it

```{r}
colnames
```

* All R functions can be easily inspected in this way

---

* Another very important attribute is "class"

* For example, the return value of `lm()` has class "lm"

```{r}
attr(fm2, "class")
```

* The class of an object can also be obtained using the function `class()`

```{r}
class(fm2)
```

---

* The class of an object can (usually) be "removed" by setting it to
  `NULL` 
  
* This is not something you should actually do!

```{r}
class(fm2) <- NULL
```

* Such objects will no longer have a "class" attribute

```{r}
attr(fm2, "class")
```

* However, it will still have a class (implicitly)

```{r}
class(fm2)
```

<!-- * We will discuss the class attribute in more details next day -->

# Class, generic functions, and methods

---

* The class of an object is fundamental to how R works

* Every object in R must have a class

* This is true even if the object does not have a class attribute


```{r}
class(colnames)
attr(colnames, "class")
class(Titanic)
attr(Titanic, "class")
```

---

* The main use of the class of an object is in how _generic functions_ behave

* Generic functions are intended to perform general tasks, like

	- `print()`

	- `plot()`

	- `summary()`

* But details of what these functions should do depends on the input


---

```{r}
print(Titanic[, , 1, 1]) 
fm1 <- lm(pm10 ~ no2, aqi, subset = (no2 < 100))
print(fm1)
```

---

```{r}
summary(Titanic) 
```

---

```{r}
summary(fm1)
```

---

* But suppose we make a copy of `fm1` and remove the class attribute from it

```{r}
fm2 <- fm1
class(fm2) <- NULL
class(fm1)
class(fm2)
```

* `fm1` and `fm2` represent the same model fit

* But the different class means that `print()` and `summary()` behave
  differently

---

```{r}
summary(fm2)
```

---

.scrollable400[

```{r}
print(fm2)
```

]

* This kind of customized output is achieved by _methods_

---

* Methods are specific implementations of a generic function customized to its input

* The appropriate method is chosen by looking at the _class_ of the input argument

--

* The methods available for a generic function can be obtained using the `methods()` function

.scrollable400[

```{r}
methods("summary")
```

]

---

.scrollable500[

```{r}
methods("print") # similar but much longer list
```

]

---

* All available methods for a given class can be similarly obtained

```{r}
methods(class = "lm")
```

---

* The name of a specific method appears to have the form `generic.class`

* However, one should always call the generic function, not the method directly

* This is not OK:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
summary.lm(fm1)
```

* Instead, use

```{r,eval=FALSE}
summary(fm1)
```

* In fact, many methods cannot be called directly because they are "hidden"

---

* This is a form of _Object Oriented Programming_ (OOP) in R

* Python also has OOP, but 

	* Methods are usually tied to a class, not a _generic_ function

	* One notable exception is the `__str__()` method, which is used by `print()`

# Getting help

* R has an extensive collection of functions (even more if we include
  add-on packages)

* It is impossible for anyone to know them all, or remember details

* Fortunately, R also has an excellent help system

--

* Every function and dataset in R (and add-on packages) must be documented

* The documentation can be accessed by `help(name)` or `?name`

* For example: `help(seq)`, `help(summary)`, etc.

* A more general (but limited) search can be performed using `help.search("search-string")`

---

# Getting help

* How the help is shown depends on the _interface_ being used

* RStudio has a separate help tab (which also allows searching)

--

* However, before using the help system, you should know how methods
  are documented

---

# Help for generic functions and methods

* Generic functions and methods are distinct functions

* They often have different help pages

* In fact, many add-on packages define new methods for generics in
  another package

* These are always documented in a separate help page

---

# Help for generic functions and methods

* To get help for the generic function `summary()`, type `help(summary)`

* To get help for the `summary()` method for "matrix" objects, type `help(summary.matrix)`

* To get help for the `summary()` method for "lm" objects, type `help(summary.lm)`

* The first two happen to be the same help page, but the third is different

--

* This is slightly confusing because you are __not__ supposed to call
  `summary.lm()` directly

* More importantly, there may not actually be a `summary()` method for
  all classes 
  
* For example, "list" objects are handled by a _fallback_ method `summary.default()`

--

* The list of available methods are obtained by `methods("summary")`
  as shown earlier
  
* All these should have a corresponding help page

---

# Help for generic functions and methods

- The system we described is called "S3" (short for "S version 3")

- The documentation refers to specific methods implemented using this system as "S3 methods"

- To make things more complicated, there are other systems of defining
  classes and methods
  
- We will skip the details of these for now


---

# Replacement Functions

* R functions are not allowed to modify its arguments

--

* Consider a function that sets negative inputs to 0
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
	0 & \text{ if } x < 0 \cr
	x & \text{ otherwise. }
\end{cases}
$$

--

* We will refer to this as the *ReLU* function

---

# The Scalar ReLU Function in R

```{r}
sReLU <- function(u) {
    if (u < 0) u = 0
    u
}
```

???

Now suppose we want to implement this function for scalar input.

This is a very natural implementation.

--

```{r}
x <- -5
sReLU(x)
x
```


???

Let's see what happens when we call it.

If we just call the function with a variable X as input, it returns
the expected value, but the variable X does not change.

---

# The Scalar ReLU Function in R

```{r}
sReLU <- function(u) {
    if (u < 0) u = 0
    u
}
```

```{r}
x <- -5
y <- sReLU(x)
```

--

```{r}
x
y
```

???

This time, when we assign the value of the function to a new variable
Y, X remains unchanged but Y now has the expected value.

This is of course more or less what we would expect.

---

# The Scalar ReLU Function in Python

```{python,cache=FALSE}
def sReLU(u):
    if u < 0:
        u = 0
    return u
```

--

```{python,cache=FALSE}
x = -5
y = sReLU(x)
```

--

```{python,cache=FALSE}
x
y
```

---

# The Vectorized ReLU Function in Python

```{python,cache=FALSE}
def vReLU(u):
    for i in range(len(u)):
        if u[i] < 0:
            u[i] = 0
    return u
```

--

```{python,cache=FALSE}
from numpy import *
x = random.normal(size = 10)
y = x
x
y
```

---

# The Vectorized ReLU Function in Python

```{python,cache=FALSE}
z = vReLU(y)
```

???

When we now call the function with Y as argument and assign the result
to a NEW variable called Z, several interesting things happen.

--

```{python,cache=FALSE}
z
```

???

First of all, Z has the negative values set to 0, as expected.

--

```{python,cache=FALSE}
y
```

???

But Y _also_ has the same values set to 0.

Even though this behaviour is not consistent with the scalar case, it
is not _too_ surprising, because the argument Y WAS actually modified
in the function.

--

```{python,cache=FALSE}
x
```

???

Perhaps more surprisingly, the value of _X_ has also changed, even
though it was not involved in the call at all.

There is actually a very good reason for this behaviour, and depending
on your PRIOR experience with programming, you may find this perfectly
natural.

But this behaviour is often surprising to beginners, and R avoids it
by following what is known as a FUNCTIONAL programming paradigm, which
says that functions should not modify its arguments.

---

# The Vectorized ReLU Function in R

```{r}
vReLU <- function(u) {
    for (i in seq_len(length(u))) {
        if (u[i] < 0)
            u[i] <- 0
    }
    return(u)
}
```

???

Here is the equivalent function in R.

--

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- x
```

--

```{r}
x
y
```

???

As before, we first generate a normal random vector X and make a copy named Y.

---

# The Vectorized ReLU Function in R

```{r}
z <- vReLU(y)
z
```

--

```{r}
y
x
```

???

This time, when we run the function with Y as argument and assign the
result to Z, only Z is modified.

X and Y remain unchanged.

---

# Alternative: Direct Assignment

* We can instead use direct assignment to a 'subset'

```{r}
y[y < 0] <- 0
```

--

```{r}
x
y
```

---

# Functional programming

* R generally follows a _functional programming_ paradigm

* Among other things, this says that functions should not modify its arguments

--

* This is a key difference between Python and R

--

* One consequence: R needs an _unusual_ approach when it needs to modify objects

---

layout: true

# Example: Modifying Names of a Data Frame

---

```{r}
d <- data.frame(1, rnorm(5), rexp(5))
names(d)
```

```{r}
d
```

* Default names are not very nice

---

* Want to change the names to `"Constant", "Normal", "Exponential"`

* Possible solution using the `setNames()` function

```{r}
setNames(d, c("Constant", "Normal", "Exponential"))
```

---

* But names of `d` are not modified by this

```{r}
d
```

--

* Best we can hope for

```r
d <- setNames(d, c("Constant", "Normal", "Exponential"))
```

---

* In fact, the __dplyr__ package has a more convenient version of this approach

```{r}
d <- dplyr::rename(d, Constant = X1, Normal = rnorm.5., Exponential = rexp.5.)
d
```

---

* The classic R Alternative: Replacement Functions

```{r}
names(d) <- c("Constant", "Normal", "Exponential")
d
```

???

But this round-about approach is not always convenient, so there is an
alternative approach that is also available.

This approach is to use so-called REPLACEMENT functions.

The idea of such functions is that they replace PARTS of an already
existing object, which is another way of saying that it MODIFIES the
object.

---

layout: false

# Replacement Functions

* Other similar examples:

```r
y[ y < 0 ] <- 0
class(x)  <- NULL
d$Normal[ d$Normal < 0 ] <- 0
attr(x, "name") <- value
```

* Common feature: "complex" expression on the LHS of the assignment

???

There are many examples of replacement functions in R

In fact, you have already seen some of them before, probably without
realising that they are doing anything unusual

They look just like assignments, but instead of a variable name, the
left-hand-side looks like a complex expression involving an existing
variable.

Once you get used to them, replacement functions are very natural, but
you will not usually encounter such usage in other programming
languages.

It is quite easy to write your own replacement functions.

But we will not discuss those details as they are not important for us
right now.
