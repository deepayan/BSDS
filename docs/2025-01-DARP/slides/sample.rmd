For this quiz, we will use the UK 2024 (provisional) road safety vehicles data available from 

<https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-accidents-safety-data>


or [here](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-accidents-safety-data).

Use the following code to read the data in R from a copy of the data at the course website.

<!-- Copy of

https://data.dft.gov.uk/road-accidents-safety-data/dft-road-casualty-statistics-vehicle-provisional-mid-year-unvalidated-2024.csv

-->

```{r}
DATALOC <- "https://deepayan.github.io/BSDS/2025-01-DARP/slides/data/rcs2024.csv"
rcs2024 <- read.csv(DATALOC)
```

Each row in the dataset describes a vehicle involved in a
collision. Multiple vehicles may be involved in a single
collision. The `collision_index` variable is an identifier for the
collision a particular vehicle was involved in.

The `sex_of_driver` variable is coded as an integer, with values 1 =
Male, 2 = Female, 3 = Not known. Missing values are coded as $-1$.


__Question 1__: Identify the **specific** collision _that_ involved the
largest number of vehicles (hint: the number of vehicles involved was
25). For this collision,

```{r,echo=FALSE}
veh_per_collision <- xtabs(~ collision_index, rcs2024) |> array2DF()
i <- which.max(veh_per_collision$Value)
max_collision_index <- veh_per_collision[i, "collision_index"]
max_collision_index
```


* How many of the drivers were Male?

```{r,echo=FALSE}
df25 <- dplyr::filter(rcs2024, collision_index == max_collision_index)
tab25 <- xtabs(~ sex_of_driver, df25)
```

```{r}
tab25["1"]
```


* How many of the drivers were Female?

```{r}
tab25["2"]
```


* Ignoring missing values, what was the average age of the Male drivers?

```{r}
df25 |> dplyr::filter(age_of_driver != -1) |> 
  dplyr::group_by(sex_of_driver) |> dplyr::summarise(mean(age_of_driver))
```


* Ignoring missing values, what was the average age of the Female drivers?



__Question 2__: Obtain the subset of the data for collisions that
involved exactly one vehicle.

* How many such collisions are recorded?

* For what proportion of such collisions is the age of the driver missing?

* For what proportion of such collisions is the sex of the driver Not known?

* Ignoring missing values, what was the average age of the Male drivers in such collisions?

* Ignoring missing values, What was the average age of the Female drivers in such collisions?

* Ignoring missing values, What was the average age of drivers with
  sex Not Known in such collisions?

* What is the most frequent vehicle type involved in such collisions?
  The meaning of the integer codes of the `vehicle_type` variable is
  explained in the attached form.

* What is the _least_ frequent vehicle type involved in such
  collisions? Exclude all vehicle types that were not involved in any
  recorded accident.




__Question 3__: Using graphical tools you have learned about, study the
empirical distribution of `age_of_driver` for different values of
`sex_of_driver` (in the entire dataset). Briefly summarize your
observations, keeping the following underlying questions in mind:

```{r}
dall <- rcs2024[c("age_of_driver", "sex_of_driver")] |> 
  subset(age_of_driver != -1  & sex_of_driver != -1)
```

* Does the age distribution of drivers involved in accidents vary by their sex?

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=4}
xtabs(~ age_of_driver + sex_of_driver, dall) |> array2DF() |> 
  lattice::barchart(Value ~ age_of_driver | sex_of_driver, origin = 0)
```


```{r}
lattice::histogram(~ age_of_driver | factor(sex_of_driver), dall,
                   scales = list(alternating = FALSE))
```

```{r}
qqmath(~ age_of_driver, dall,
       groups = factor(sex_of_driver), grid = TRUE,
       auto.key = TRUE, 
       par.settings = simpleTheme(pch = ".", cex = 3))
```



* If we wanted to summarize the age distributions by sex, what would
  be an appropriate measure (e.g., sample mean, sample median, something else?)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(htmlwidgets)
p <- ggplot(airquality) + geom_point(aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone))
ggplotly(p)
```
