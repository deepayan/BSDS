# Interacting with R

* R is most commonly used as a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)

	* When it is started, R Waits for user input

	* User inputs expression

	* R evaluates and prints result

	* Waits for more input

--

* Python supports exactly the same model 

--

* Several _interfaces_ are available to help in this process

* Recommended options (representing slightly different approaches)

	* RStudio
	
	* Jupyter

---

# Running R

* On starting up, R shows you something like this:

```
R version 4.2.2 Patched (2022-11-17 r83375) -- "Innocent and Trusting"
Copyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

>
```

* The `>` represents a _prompt_ indicating that R is waiting for input

---

# Running Python

* Python has a similar but much shorter start-up message:

```
Python 3.9.12 (main, Apr  5 2022, 01:53:17) 
[Clang 12.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

* The `>>>` similarly represents the _prompt_ indicating that Python is waiting

# Basic Usage of R

---

# R is a full programming language

* Variables

* Functions

* Control flow structures

	* For loops, while loops

	* If-then-else (branching)

--

* Distinguishing features

	* Focus on _vectors_ and _vectorized operations_ 

	* Treatment of _functions_ at par with other object types

---

# R is easily extensible

* Most standard data analysis methods are already implemented

* Can be extended by writing add-on packages

* Thousands of add-on packages are available

---

# Major concepts we need to know

* Variables (in the context of programming)

--

* Data structures needed for data analyis

--

* Functions (set of instructions for performing a procedure)

---

# Variables

* Variables are symbols that may be associated with different values

* Computations involving variables are done using their current value

```r
sqrt(x)
```

```
Error: object 'x' not found
```

---

# Variables

* Variables are symbols that may be associated with different values

* Computations involving variables are done using their current value



```r
x <- 10 # assignment
sqrt(x)
```

```

```

```r
x <- -1

```
Warning in sqrt(x): NaNs produced
```

```
[1] NaN
```

```r

```

```
[1] 0+1i
```

---

# Data structures for data analysis

* Vectors

* Matrices 

* Data frames (a spreadsheet-like data set)

* Lists (general collection of objects)

---

# Atomic vectors

* Indexed collection of homogeneous scalars, can be 

    * Numeric / Integer / Complex

    <!-- * Categorical (factor) -->

    * Character

    * Logical (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)
	
--

* Missing values are allowed, indicated as `NA`


--

* Elements are indexed starting from 1


--

* $i$th element of vector `x` can be extracted using `x[[i]]`

* There are also more sophisticated forms of (vector) indexing



---

# Atomic vectors: examples


```r

# Life Exepectancy in Australia

```r
year <- c(1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977,
          1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007)
year
```

```

```

???

Here, we create two vectors containing the data using the C function.

The first variable contains the values of _years_, 

--


```r
lexp_aus <- c(69.12, 70.33, 70.93, 71.1, 71.93, 73.49,
              74.74, 76.32, 77.56, 78.83, 80.37, 81.235)
lexp_aus
```

```
 [1] 69.120 70.330 70.930 71.100 71.930 73.490 74.740 76.320 77.560 78.830 80.370 81.235
```

???


and the second contains the reported life expectancies in Australia in these years.

Notice that the values for year are equally spaced, from 1952 to 2007
with a gap of five years.


---



```r
year <- seq(1952, 2007, by = 5)
year
```

```
 [1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007
```

???

This means that we can use the SEQUENCE function that we have seen
earlier to create this vector in a more efficient way.

This use of S-E-Q is a little different from the use we have seen
previously. 

This raises the obvious question: Even if we _know_ that a function
exists, how can we know the different ways in which the function can
be used?

We will address this question soon when we discuss how to use the help
system in R.


---


```r
plot(year, lexp_aus, pch = 16)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-48](figures/1-introunnamed-chunk-48-1.svg)

???

Now that we have input the data, a good first step is to plot it.

We will learn about more sophisticated ways of plotting later, but
trying the PLOT function is usually a good first step.

This plot shows that life expectancy in Australia has increased
steadily, from slightly less than 70 years, to slightly more than 80
years, in the time period under observation.

But it also shows that the improvement really started from around 1970
and not before then. So, a natural next step could be to look at the
_changes_ in life expectancy every five years.

For this, we need to compute the _successive differences_ in the
values stored in the vector of life expectancies.

This is something that should be quite simple to do, and it is.

But before looking at the simple solution, let us look at a solution
that is not so simple, but one that only uses what we already know.

---


```r
lexp_aus[[2]] - lexp_aus[[1]]
```

```
[1] 1.21
```

???

Remember that we can extract individual elements of a vector using the
double square bracket notation. 

Extracting the first two and taking their difference gives us the
first difference.

---


```r
c(lexp_aus[[2]] - lexp_aus[[1]], lexp_aus[[3]] - lexp_aus[[2]],
  lexp_aus[[4]] - lexp_aus[[3]], lexp_aus[[5]] - lexp_aus[[4]],
  lexp_aus[[6]] - lexp_aus[[5]], lexp_aus[[7]] - lexp_aus[[6]],
  lexp_aus[[8]] - lexp_aus[[7]], lexp_aus[[9]] - lexp_aus[[8]],
  lexp_aus[[10]] - lexp_aus[[9]], lexp_aus[[11]] - lexp_aus[[10]],
  lexp_aus[[12]] - lexp_aus[[11]])
```

```
 [1] 1.210 0.600 0.170 0.830 1.560 1.250 1.580 1.240 1.270 1.540 0.865
```

???

By repeating this calculation eleven times, and combining the results,
we can get the vector of successive differences.

But of course this is not a practical method, because it will not
scale to even moderately large datasets.

If you have some experience with programming before, you will know
that a FOR LOOP can be useful for repetitive calculations like this. 

Let us see how we can use a FOR LOOP in R to simplify this problem.

---


```r
d <- numeric(0)
```

???

First, we create a vector of length 0 in which the answer will be stored.

--


```r
for (i in 1:11) {
    d <- c(d, lexp_aus[[i+1]] - lexp_aus[[i]])
}
d
```

```
 [1] 1.210 0.600 0.170 0.830 1.560 1.250 1.580 1.240 1.270 1.540 0.865
```

???

Next we create a FOR LOOP, where this notation means, that the loop
index __i__ will vary over the values in the vector containing the
sequence from __one to eleven__.

In each __iteration__ of the loop, we add the i-th component of the
difference to the result, updating the variable named D every time.

In many languages this would have been a perfectly reasonable approach.

In R, unfortunately, this approach would not be considered a good
solution because it can be inefficient.

---


```r
lexp_aus[-1] - lexp_aus[-12]
```

```
 [1] 1.210 0.600 0.170 0.830 1.560 1.250 1.580 1.240 1.270 1.540 0.865
```

???

The __right__ solution requires one more piece of information that we
do not yet have, namely how to do __vector indexing__. 

We will learn about this in the very next video, after which the
solution shown here will make sense.

But the intuition here should already be clear: by using a negative
integer as index, we drop the corresponding element from a vector, and
then simply take the difference of two such vectors.

--


```r
diff(lexp_aus)
```

```
 [1] 1.210 0.600 0.170 0.830 1.560 1.250 1.580 1.240 1.270 1.540 0.865
```

???

This operation is so common and important in data analysis that there
is also a built-in function for it.

This function is called DIFF, which takes a vector as input, and when
no other arguments are specified, returns the vector of successive
differences.

---


```r
d <- diff(lexp_aus)
median(d)
```

```
[1] 1.24
```

```r
mean(d)
```

```
[1] 1.101364
```


---


```r
plot(d, pch = 16, type = "o", ylab = "difference", xlab = "period")
```
